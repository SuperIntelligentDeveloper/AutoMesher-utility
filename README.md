# AutoMesher-utility
Are you tired of having to fiddle around with meshes in unity? Wish you can just import an .obj file and it just... generates a usable mesh for your mesh colliders? Well wish no more thanks to the AutoMesher utility! A unity package that you can easily import and go! It automatically detects any obj file you import, collects all the meshes, and compiles it into one usable mesh. Its that easy! Its ideal for big models that unity chops up into individual meshes for all the individual parts. Its very useful for Mesh Colliders and other components too! So yeah. AutoMesher, the open-source alternative.



How to import for dummies:

*this method is for unity 6.1, I don't know about older versions*

1. Open your project or create a new one.
2. At the top of your window, click on Assets, then Import Package, then Custom Package.
3. This will open your system's file manager. Go into the folder where you downloaded my unitypackage file, and select it.
4. In unity, it might show a window with some checkmarks. Just check them all if not checked and click Import.
5. Unity should import and run the package.
6. Try importing an obj file, it should generate a usable mesh!


Limitations:

- It doesn't support other 3D model files, only obj at the moment.
- It might work for some older versions of unity, but it might be buggy or limited, let me know what happens.
- This is not beginner-proof, if you don't know what a mesh is, don't bother.

Credits:

- Just me, a solo developer, and Microsoft copilot, feel free to distribute, but please not commercially and please make sure you credit me for the original thing. It has a GNU GPL v3.0 license (have no idea what that is, I just picked a random license). Thanks!


Oh yeah, there will be updates, but its not my main priority, its more of a side-quest.
