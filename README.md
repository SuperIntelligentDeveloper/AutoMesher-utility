Are you tired of having to fiddle around with meshes in unity? Wish you can just import an .obj file and it just... generates a usable mesh for your mesh colliders? Well wish no more thanks to the AutoMesher utility! A unity package that you can easily import and go! It automatically detects any obj file you import,
